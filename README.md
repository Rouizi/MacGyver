# MacGyver

MacGyver must escape from a labyrinth whose exit is blocked by a guard. MacGyver must find a way to escape and to do so he must 
find various elements, randomly placed in the labyrinth, to make a syringe that will serve to asleep the guard. Without it, MacGyver 
is not strong enough to defeat him and dies like a hero but dies anyway ...
